description: "I am a designer from Ottawa, Canada. I’m a passionate problem solver and love designing for myself and others. My focus is packaging design, branding & identity, UI/UX, illustration and print media. Most of all I make
beautiful designs that communicate to every challenge.
Of course I love all things design related, but I also enjoy traveling, drinking tea, crafting and my cat. When I’m not designing you can find me enjoying the outdoors or spending time with friends and family."
